# Introduction
Welcome to the Arduino tutorials!

In this series, you will learn basic electrical engineering and programming to build several fun projects. These will include various sensors, motors, and displays.

## Organization
If this is your first time using an Arduino, please go through our first few courses in the introduction section of the lessons page (next page). These lessons will give you all of the skills necessary to build our projects.

After going through the lessons in the introduction section, you are welcome to go through the rest of the lessons in any order you please. These lessons are split into two types:

### Projects
Projects are fun lessons that walk you through how to a simple project that can normally be done in one session. These have varying difficulties, so do higher difficulty lessons at your own risk.

### Kit Component Lessons
Your Arduino kit has many sensors, lights, motors, and displays. If you have an idea for your own project or you simply want to learn about the various components, these lessons are for you.

On some of these lessons I got kind of lazy so you might find links to tutorials on other websites. There are a lot of components in the kit and I can't write lessons for them all.
