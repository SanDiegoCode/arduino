# What is an Arduino?
To put it simply, an Arduino is a simple, small, easily programmable microcontroller. This means it can:

 * control stuff like lights, motors, and displays
 * read data from sensors, like potentiometers or distance sensors
 * be programmed for your own needs

The Arduino is relatively popular and very cheap. It is also very easy to use and program, making it ideal for beginners.
